                To make use of the Webaim accessibility test, we started by downloading the web extension for easy access. We found this to be the easiest way to use it for our local website. Before we started,
                 we decided we wanted a responsive webpage, so it could be used by phones and smaller devices as well as PC. Before we started coding, we also found a small color palette that we would use for 
                the whole website (apart from the accessibility page where we used another set of colors). We did this to stay consistent and to have good color contrasts. We decided to be consistent for the design 
                of all the pages but the accessibility page.  We wanted to use the accessibility page to show more of our skills and knowledge and therefore changed the design completely on this page. To make it easier 
                to make the pages responsive and to make them cleaner and tidier, we started the programming process by making a grid layout for the intro page, campus page, and topical page. We made another layout 
                for our accessibility page. To Make the pages responsive we used the media query in CSS, and then changed the grid layout when the screen size was minimized. We decided to add a navigation bar at the 
                top of the page so the reader could easily navigate through our website. When the screen size reaches a certain width the navigation bar is changed to a dropdown menu. This is because we felt the normal 
                navigation bar took up too much space when the screen was minimized. Some things we focused on when producing our page was to use headings in the correct order and dividing each paragraph/element on a 
                page to make it easy to read and locate information. When we tested our site, we tested all our pages to make sure we stayed consisted with the styling and layout theme of our website. We also wanted 
                to make sure every page did not contain any mistakes we may have overlooked. Since we stayed consistent through the whole project and focused on not missing any details, we were happy to see that the 
                webaim accessibility test found zero errors on all our pages.
